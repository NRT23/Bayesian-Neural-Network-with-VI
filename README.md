# Bayesian Neural Network with Variational Inference and MC Dropout
Pytorch implementaiton of a Neural Network with Variational Inference using Bayes by Backprop and MC Dropout algorithms
•	Flexible implementations with the desired structure and priors
•	Priors and noise can be learned from the data
•	Homo- and heteroscedastic uncertainties can be quantified
